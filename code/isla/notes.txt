[0]: > this section will define the axiom system IS(A) and some of its
generalizations.

Our axiom systems will employ a set of seven non-growth functions, called the
groundingfunctions. They will include:
1. Integer Subtraction where x - y is defined to equal zero when x < y,
2. Integer Division where x/y = x when y = 0, and it otherwise equals floor(x/y).
3. Predecessor(x) = Max(x - 1, 0),
4. Maximum(x, y),
5. Logarithm(x) = ceiling(Log2(x + 1)),
6. Root(x, y) - floor(x^(1/y)) when y > 1, and Root(x, 0) = x.
7. Count(x, j) designating the number of "1" bits among x's rightmost j bits
