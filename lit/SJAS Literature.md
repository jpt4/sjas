    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeuti%27s_conjecture
>Takeuti's conjecture is equivalent to the consistency of [second-order arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_arithmetic) in the sense that each of the statements can be derived from each other in the weak system [PRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_arithmetic); [consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_proof) refers here to the truth of the [Gödel sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_sentence) for second-order arithmetic. It is also equivalent to the [strong normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_normalization) of the Girard/Reynold's [System F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_F).

System F is strongly normalizing and consistent, but can't (fully) self-interpret, per [[BrownPalsberg2016]]
