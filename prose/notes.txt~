There are several threads to follow: consistency vs completeness;
self-provability of consistency vs completeness; decidable vs
undecidable properties; Turing Complete vs sub-Turing languages;
expressivity vs guranteed behavior; self-interpretability; autonomous
meaning/transcendental syntax; reflexivity/self-referentiability;
self-modification.

My unifying interest in the above is Cognitive Sovereignty, the degree
to which a cognitive entity can be secure in its power over the
operation of its intelligence, against threats both foreign and
domestic. The lens through which I examined this complex of concepts
for several years was Pervasively Reconfigurable Computation
