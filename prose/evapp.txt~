The first stage of the application is answering a few basic questions
and attaching a brief proposal. Once we receive it, we'll follow up
with you about next steps or let you know that we have declined.

The proposal should consist of a proposal no longer than 1500
words. You may also attach supplementary materials, but we will read
the proposal first and it must stand on its own.

    The first part of the proposal should be about you. Tell us your
    personal story, and how it relates to what you wish to do. We
    probably don't care much about your formal education, credentials,
    or awards, unless they're particularly germane to who you are or
    your idea. Do tell us your background briefly, but credentials are
    not what will impress us.  Second, what is one mainstream or
    "consensus" view that you absolutely agree with? (This is our
    version of a "trick" question, reversing the now-fashionable
    contrarianism.)  The third part should be about your
    idea. Convince us that this is a great idea worth investing in,
    and tell us what is new or unusual in your vision and
    understanding. What's the problem you intend to solve? If you have
    a ballpark budget (with revenue sources and expenses), let us know
    the bare basics now; we won't hold you to it strictly.

Also (if applicable) tell us how long you have been working on this
project or idea, whether you will be working on it full time or part
time, any existing formal or informal partnerships or supporters, and
how you might intend to reach your users or audience.

I strongly identify with environmental protectionist and
conservationist attitudes. The EPA is, on the whole, a good
institution; the Interior is my favortite executive department; bison
and wolves should repopulate the prairie; industry must be balanced
against, and subordinated to, the sustainable quality of our water,
soil, air, wildlife, and citizenry. I believe that systems thinking is
turned toward its highest end when considering the best ways to
interact with, leverage, and improve the multi-generational cycles of
our ecosystem, which form the fundamental substrate of all other human
prosperity. This conviction is not only mainstream, but universal: I,
like all the world, prefer to breath clean air, drink untainted water,
enjoy amicable climes, and observe the fluorishing of life. To be
absent any of these is an indication of a gave
