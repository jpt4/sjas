Inaugurating the study of Autarkic Formal Systems

Executive Summary

Project Description

Statement of Significance

Outputs
An Autarkic Formal Systems website, to document the project and attract the attention of additional contributors. This website will publish a series of essays explaining the various results AFS seeks to unify, and log all research progress in public, to the fullest extent possible. This will allow the long tail of potentially interested mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists, independent scholars, and laypersons to 

Sponsored research prizes for specific problems of interest to AFS. 


Outcomes

By receiving this grant, AFS will establish itself as a viable research programme, and greatly strengthen the cross-disciplinary familiarity of several currently disconnected sub-fields in mathematics and computer science. It will answer several questions critical to the study of Autarkic Formal Systems, and lay the foundation for the discover of both further specific results, and the development of more general theoretical frameworks characterizing formal autarky. It will bring together many interesting and productive individuals from across academia, industry, and independent endeavor, with
